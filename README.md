# FreestyleJam
-y3tii Freestyle Jam V1.04-
For training Yvona Renown which was added in the MusicQ update. Equip a silent score scroll that lasts 1 minute.
Yvona training caps at 2000 exp daily, 40 exp per 1 minute play, and another 40 exp for completing 5 combos.
This means that Yvona takes 50 minutes a day to cap, or 25 minutes with perfect combos.

This Freestyle Jam bot will scan a portion of your screen and automate the key-presses required for the minigame. This allows you to achieve perfect combos every time, barring server lag or any other lag that may be experienced. The Freestyle Jam skill will be reactivated when the current jam has finished.
You can leave this bot running for 25 minutes per irl day, to complete Yvona's daily renown requirements, or for even less if you leave this bot playing in an area currently blessed with the Blessing of Cairbre.

Place the Freestyle Jam skill onto your hotkey bar in F1 position.
You can change the default values used in freestyle.ini
